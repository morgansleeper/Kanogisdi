ᎧᏃᎩᏍᏗ/Kanogisdi (/kʰanoːkiːsti/ 'singing') is a Cherokee UTAUloid, which can be used to create synthesized vocal music in the Cherokee language. Kanogisdi should work with any UTAU-compatible software, but was designed with [OpenUtau](http://www.openutau.com) in mind.

## Using Kanogisdi

To get started:

1. Download the latest version of Kanogisdi (`Kanogisdi_v0-0-YYYYMMDD.zip`) from this repository above, and read the license ([`LICENSE.md`](https://github.com/morgansleeper/Kanogisdi/blob/main/LICENSE.md)).
2. If you haven't already, download and install [OpenUtau](http://www.openutau.com)
3. Follow the instructions [here](https://github.com/stakira/OpenUtau/wiki/Getting-Started#install-a-voicebank) to install Kanogisdi as a voicebank! (Make sure to select 'UTF-8' as the 'Archive File Encoding')
4. Once installed, select Kanogisdi from the 'Select Singer' button on a track on the left, and choose the 'Default' phonemizer and 'Classic' renderer options
5. ᏘᏃᎩ!
